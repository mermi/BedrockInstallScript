BedrockInstallScript
====================

Linux Install Script for Bedrock on Ubuntu

This is a simple bash script that installs and configure Bedrock on my computer.

This way I don't have to dig into dependency hell when I set up a VM or upgrade my machine.

You need to have forked Bedrock first on Github since it sets it up based on your fork.

WFM, it may work for you too ;)
